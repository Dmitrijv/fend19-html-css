              <h3>Why Mars?</h3>
              <p>
                After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system due to several reasons: Its soil
                contains water to extract It isnâ€™t too cold or too hot. It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that
                offers protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation.

              <p>
                Before carefully selected and trained crews will depart to Mars, several unmanned missions will be
                completed, establishing a habitable settlement waiting for the first astronauts to arrive.

              <h3>Sustainable Sun</h3>
              <p>
                The Sun is a reliable, robust, and plentiful energy source. Using solar panels is the best choice for
                Mars One since it takes away the requirement to develop and launch a nuclear reactor, thereby saving
                time and money while avoiding the risks and concerns of the use of a nuclear power source.
