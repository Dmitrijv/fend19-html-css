          <a href="./">Mars One</a> aims to establish a permanent human settlement on Mars. Mars is the only planet we
          know of that can currently feasibly support human life and will be humankind’s first step to become a
          multiplanetary species. Mars One’s crews will go to Mars not to simply visit, but to live, explore, and create
          a second home for humanity. The first men and women to go to Mars are going there to stay.

            <h1>Why Mars?</h1>
            <p>
              After the Earth, Mars is the most habitable planet in our solar system due to several reasons: Its soil
              contains water to extract It isn’t too cold or too hot. It has an atmosphere (albeit a thin one) that
              offers protection from cosmic and the Sun's radiation.

            <p>
              Before carefully selected and trained crews will depart to Mars, several unmanned missions will be
              completed, establishing a habitable settlement waiting for the first astronauts to arrive.

            <h1>Sustainable Sun</h1>
            <p>
              The Sun is a reliable, robust, and plentiful energy source. Using solar panels is the best choice for Mars
              One since it takes away the requirement to develop and launch a nuclear reactor, thereby saving time and
              money while avoiding the risks and concerns of the use of a nuclear power source.
